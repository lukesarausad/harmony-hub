# Harmony Hub: Cross-Platform Music Collaboration App

## Project Overview
Build a web application that allows users to create, share, and collaborate on music playlists across different streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.). The app will serve as a social hub for music enthusiasts who use different streaming services but want to share and discover music together.

## Core Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
1. **User Authentication**
   - Sign up/login system
   - Connection to multiple streaming services (OAuth integration)
   - Profile management

2. **Playlist Management**
   - Create new collaborative playlists
   - Add songs from different streaming platforms
   - View and edit existing playlists
   - Handle cross-platform song availability

3. **Social Features**
   - Add friends/follow other users
   - Activity feed showing recent playlist changes
   - Comments and reactions on playlists and songs

### Future Enhancements
1. Real-time collaborative editing
2. Music taste compatibility metrics
3. Themed playlist challenges
4. Advanced recommendation system

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with hooks
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Material-UI or Chakra UI
- **API Calls**: Axios or Fetch API

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user data, playlists)
- **Authentication**: JWT, Passport.js for OAuth
- **API Integration**: Spotify Web API, Apple Music API, YouTube Music API

### Optional
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for collaborative features
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Authentication
1. Set up project structure (frontend and backend)
2. Implement basic authentication (signup, login)
3. Add OAuth integration for Spotify (as the first platform)
4. Create user profiles and settings

### Phase 2: Core Playlist Functionality
1. Create data models for playlists and tracks
2. Implement playlist CRUD operations
3. Build UI for playlist creation and viewing
4. Add song search functionality using Spotify API

### Phase 3: Collaboration Features
1. Implement friend/follow system
2. Create activity feed
3. Add commenting and reaction features
4. Build initial version of the dashboard

### Phase 4: Cross-Platform Integration
1. Add Apple Music API integration
2. Implement cross-platform song matching
3. Handle platform-specific limitations
4. Test and refine the user experience

## UI Implementation Guidelines

### Dashboard/Home Feed
- Clean, card-based design for playlists
- Activity indicators for recent changes
- Quick filters for different views
- Music player component that works across platforms

### Playlist View
- Left panel: Track listing with platform indicators
- Right panel: Collaboration activity and comments
- Prominent album artwork display
- Clear visual cues for platform compatibility

### Profile Pages
- Music taste visualization
- Activity timeline
- Showcase for favorite playlists
- Collaboration statistics

## API Integration Notes

### Spotify Web API
- Documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
- Key endpoints:
  - Authentication: `/authorize`, `/token`
  - Playlists: `/v1/playlists`, `/v1/me/playlists`
  - Tracks: `/v1/tracks`, `/v1/search`

### Apple Music API
- Documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/
- MusicKit JS for web integration
- JWT-based authentication

### Data Modeling Considerations
- Handle different track identifiers across platforms
- Store mapping between equivalent tracks on different services
- Track availability metadata for each platform

## Development Tips
1. Start with a single platform (Spotify) to build core functionality
2. Use mock data initially for cross-platform features
3. Focus on responsive design from the beginning
4. Implement proper error handling for API limitations
5. Consider rate limits and caching strategies
6. Plan for offline functionality where possible
